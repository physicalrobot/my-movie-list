##Workout Fitness Tracker


#Description


This is a program designed to track your workout routines. It demonstrates my ability to connect a frontend written in React Js to a backend database written in Ruby on Rails. It includes a user authentication feature as well.

After signing in you, you can select a date on the calendar, and add workouts from the list of recorded workouts below. A more in depth explanation of the project and how its made can be found here: https://physicalrobot.github.io/code_blog/portfolio/fitness-app-with-user-authentication/
