# My Movie List   

## Learning Goals

- Build a web basic API with Ruby on Rails and Active Record to support a React
  frontend

## Introduction

This app allows users to review movies from a shared library and curate their own list of favorite movies. 

The focus of this project is **building a Rails API backend** that uses
**Active Record** to access and persist data in a database, which will be used
by a separate **React frontend** that interacts with the database via the API. I'm also using Active Storage with Google Cloud Services to store and display the images on the website.
